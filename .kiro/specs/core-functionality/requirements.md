# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification focuses on implementing the core functionality needed to make GameCompare.ai a working, production-ready application. The goal is to stop feature sprawl and deliver a functional product that users can actually use to discover games through AI-powered chat.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Foundation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search and discover games, so that I can find games that match my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL have a populated database with at least 1,000 games from RAWG API
2. WHEN a user searches for games THEN the system SHALL return relevant results from the populated database
3. WHEN game data is ingested THEN the system SHALL include title, description, genres, platforms, release date, and store links
4. WHEN game data is processed THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings for semantic search capabilities

### Requirement 2: Working API Backend

**User Story:** As a user, I want to chat with an AI about games, so that I can get personalized recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a chat message THEN the system SHALL return relevant game recommendations
2. WHEN the API processes a request THEN the system SHALL use vector similarity search to find matching games
3. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL integrate with OpenAI GPT-4 for natural language responses
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and return meaningful error messages
5. WHEN users apply filters THEN the system SHALL respect price, platform, genre, and release date constraints

### Requirement 3: Supabase Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend services deployed and working, so that the frontend can communicate with a real API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN all Supabase Edge Functions SHALL be deployed and accessible
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL authenticate using proper service role keys
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL use the existing schema with proper RLS policies
4. WHEN functions are called THEN the system SHALL return properly formatted JSON responses

### Requirement 4: Basic Admin Authentication

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to log into the system, so that I can manage game data and monitor the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin visits /admin THEN the system SHALL present a login form
2. WHEN admin credentials are entered THEN the system SHALL authenticate using Supabase Auth
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL redirect to an admin dashboard
4. WHEN unauthorized users access admin routes THEN the system SHALL redirect to login
5. WHEN admins are logged in THEN the system SHALL provide access to data management functions

### Requirement 5: Data Management Interface

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to manage game data, so that I can ensure the database is accurate and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display game statistics and recent activity
2. WHEN an admin wants to trigger data ingestion THEN the system SHALL provide a manual sync button
3. WHEN data ingestion runs THEN the system SHALL display progress and completion status
4. WHEN ingestion completes THEN the system SHALL show summary statistics (games added, updated, errors)
5. WHEN errors occur during ingestion THEN the system SHALL log errors and display them to admins

### Requirement 6: Production Deployment

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the application online, so that I can use it without running it locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible via a public URL
2. WHEN users visit the site THEN all functionality SHALL work without errors
3. WHEN the application runs in production THEN it SHALL handle concurrent users efficiently
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them properly for debugging
5. WHEN the application starts THEN all environment variables SHALL be properly configured
