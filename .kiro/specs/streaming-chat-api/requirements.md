# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently has a chat interface that expects to stream responses from the AI, but the backend API only provides non-streaming responses. Users are experiencing 404 errors when trying to use the chat functionality because the `/api/similar/stream` endpoint doesn't exist. This feature will add streaming support to the existing API router to enable real-time chat responses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive streaming AI responses in the chat interface, so that I can see the response being generated in real-time rather than waiting for the complete response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a chat message THEN the system SHALL stream the AI response back in chunks
2. WHEN the streaming endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return a proper streaming response with appropriate headers
3. WHEN streaming fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to the existing non-streaming endpoint
4. WHEN the stream is complete THEN the system SHALL properly close the connection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the streaming endpoint to maintain the same security and validation as the existing API, so that the application remains secure and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the streaming endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL validate the SERVICE_ROLE_KEY authorization
2. WHEN the streaming endpoint receives a request THEN the system SHALL apply the same rate limiting as other endpoints
3. WHEN the streaming endpoint processes input THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize the input using the same schema
4. WHEN security checks fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses with proper status codes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the streaming chat to maintain conversation context, so that my chat history is preserved and the AI can provide contextual responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a streaming request includes a conversation_id THEN the system SHALL use the existing conversation
2. WHEN no conversation_id is provided THEN the system SHALL create or retrieve a conversation for the session
3. WHEN the AI response is generated THEN the system SHALL save both user and assistant messages to the conversation history
4. WHEN conversation tracking fails THEN the system SHALL continue with the request but log the error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the streaming endpoint to have proper monitoring and logging, so that I can track performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a streaming request is processed THEN the system SHALL log the request with the same format as other endpoints
2. WHEN streaming completes or fails THEN the system SHALL record performance metrics
3. WHEN errors occur during streaming THEN the system SHALL log structured error information
4. WHEN the stream is active THEN the system SHALL handle client disconnections gracefully
