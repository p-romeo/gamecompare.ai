# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GameCompare.ai codebase has accumulated numerous files, scripts, and documentation that need organization and cleanup. The project contains duplicated functionality, unused files, scattered documentation, and inconsistent file organization that impacts maintainability and developer experience. This cleanup will streamline the codebase while preserving all essential functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and organized codebase structure, so that I can easily navigate, understand, and maintain the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN the codebase SHALL have a logical, consistent organization with clear separation of concerns
2. WHEN looking for specific functionality THEN related files SHALL be grouped together in appropriate directories
3. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN the project structure SHALL be intuitive and self-explanatory
4. WHEN searching for files THEN there SHALL be no duplicate or redundant files serving the same purpose

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consolidated and organized documentation, so that I can quickly find relevant information without searching through multiple scattered files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN looking for deployment information THEN all deployment-related docs SHALL be consolidated into a single comprehensive guide
2. WHEN seeking troubleshooting help THEN all troubleshooting information SHALL be organized by category and easily searchable
3. WHEN understanding the API THEN all API documentation SHALL be in one centralized location
4. WHEN reviewing project documentation THEN there SHALL be no duplicate or conflicting information across files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want streamlined build and validation scripts, so that I can run necessary checks without confusion about which scripts to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running build validation THEN there SHALL be a single, comprehensive validation script that covers all necessary checks
2. WHEN executing tests THEN the test organization SHALL be clear with no duplicate test configurations
3. WHEN performing security checks THEN there SHALL be one consolidated security validation process
4. WHEN building the project THEN the build process SHALL be optimized and free of redundant steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want organized utility functions and shared code, so that I can reuse functionality without duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing new features THEN shared utilities SHALL be easily discoverable and well-organized
2. WHEN looking for existing functionality THEN there SHALL be no duplicate utility functions across different directories
3. WHEN using monitoring or performance utilities THEN they SHALL be consolidated into a coherent system
4. WHEN accessing database utilities THEN they SHALL be organized by functionality and purpose

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean configuration files, so that I can understand and modify project settings without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the project THEN configuration files SHALL be minimal and focused on their specific purpose
2. WHEN setting up environments THEN environment configuration SHALL be clear and well-documented
3. WHEN modifying build settings THEN there SHALL be no conflicting or redundant configuration files
4. WHEN deploying the project THEN deployment configuration SHALL be streamlined and error-free

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want removed unused and obsolete files, so that the codebase remains lean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project THEN there SHALL be no unused or dead code files
2. WHEN looking at dependencies THEN there SHALL be no unused packages or imports
3. WHEN reviewing logs and reports THEN old build artifacts and temporary files SHALL be removed
4. WHEN checking version control THEN files that should be ignored SHALL be properly excluded
