# Requirements Document

## Introduction

GameCompare.ai is an AI-powered game recommendation platform that helps users discover games through conversational AI. The system ingests game metadata from multiple sources (RAWG, Steam, OpenCritic), uses semantic search with embeddings, and provides intelligent recommendations through GPT-4o. The platform includes affiliate monetization through tracked store redirects.

The current implementation has a solid foundation with database schema, Edge Functions scaffolding, and frontend structure, but requires completion of core AI integration, data ingestion pipelines, and user-facing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a gamer, I want to ask natural language questions about games and receive intelligent recommendations, so that I can discover games that match my preferences without manually browsing through catalogs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a chat message THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings for the query using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model
2. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL query Pinecone vector database to find semantically similar games
3. WHEN similar games are found THEN the system SHALL use GPT-4o to generate a conversational response with personalized recommendations
4. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL include game titles, prices, platforms, and brief descriptions
5. WHEN responses are generated THEN the system SHALL stream the response to provide real-time feedback to users

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a gamer, I want to compare two specific games side-by-side, so that I can make informed purchasing decisions based on detailed analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests game comparison THEN the system SHALL retrieve detailed metadata for both games from the database
2. WHEN game data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL use GPT-4o to generate a structured comparison covering gameplay, graphics, story, and value
3. WHEN comparisons are generated THEN the system SHALL highlight key differences and similarities between the games
4. WHEN displaying comparisons THEN the system SHALL include current pricing and platform availability
5. WHEN users click store links THEN the system SHALL log the click and redirect with affiliate tracking

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want the system to automatically ingest fresh game data from multiple sources, so that recommendations stay current and comprehensive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the RAWG ingestion function runs THEN the system SHALL fetch updated game data since the last sync checkpoint
2. WHEN new game data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL transform and normalize the data to match the database schema
3. WHEN game data is stored THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings for searchable text content and store them in Pinecone
4. WHEN Steam data is ingested THEN the system SHALL update pricing, platform availability, and user review scores
5. WHEN OpenCritic data is ingested THEN the system SHALL update professional critic scores for games
6. WHEN ingestion completes THEN the system SHALL update sync checkpoints to track the last successful run

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a gamer, I want to filter game recommendations by my preferences like price range, platforms, and playtime, so that I only see games that fit my constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL combine semantic search results with filter constraints
2. WHEN price filters are applied THEN the system SHALL only return games within the specified price range
3. WHEN platform filters are applied THEN the system SHALL only return games available on selected platforms
4. WHEN playtime filters are applied THEN the system SHALL only return games matching the time commitment preference
5. WHEN year range filters are applied THEN the system SHALL only return games released within the specified period

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to monetize the platform through affiliate links, so that the service can generate revenue while providing value to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users click on game store links THEN the system SHALL log the click event with game ID, store, and timestamp
2. WHEN redirecting to stores THEN the system SHALL append appropriate affiliate IDs to the destination URLs
3. WHEN affiliate links are generated THEN the system SHALL support Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG affiliate programs
4. WHEN click tracking fails THEN the system SHALL still redirect users to maintain user experience
5. WHEN generating store links THEN the system SHALL prioritize stores with active affiliate partnerships

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring, so that I can maintain system reliability and quickly resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls to external services fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts
2. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
3. WHEN ingestion functions fail THEN the system SHALL continue operating with existing data rather than crashing
4. WHEN vector operations fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to text-based search methods
5. WHEN monitoring thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL alert administrators of potential issues

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-structured API interfaces and proper authentication, so that the system is secure and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Edge Functions are called THEN the system SHALL validate authentication using SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
2. WHEN API responses are generated THEN the system SHALL conform exactly to the defined TypeScript interfaces
3. WHEN CORS requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle preflight requests and set appropriate headers
4. WHEN unauthorized requests are made THEN the system SHALL return 401 status with appropriate error messages
5. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL enforce rate limiting to prevent abuse
