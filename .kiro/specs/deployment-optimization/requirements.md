# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GameCompare.ai application currently has excessive testing overhead, complex build processes, and potential deployment issues that need to be streamlined. This feature will optimize the application for production deployment by reducing unnecessary testing complexity, simplifying the build process, and ensuring reliable Vercel deployment without compromising core functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a streamlined build process with minimal testing overhead, so that deployments are fast and reliable without unnecessary complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL complete in under 2 minutes
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL run only essential tests that validate core functionality
3. WHEN the build fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages without excessive validation steps
4. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN the system SHALL use a simplified build command without redundant checks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate redundant and failing tests, so that the CI/CD pipeline is reliable and focuses on critical functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL execute only tests that validate business-critical features
2. WHEN test files have type conflicts THEN the system SHALL either fix or remove problematic tests
3. WHEN integration tests fail due to mocking issues THEN the system SHALL remove or fix the mock configurations
4. WHEN e2e tests require manual setup THEN the system SHALL make them optional or remove them from the main pipeline

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized package.json scripts, so that build and deployment processes are efficient and don't include unnecessary steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN npm scripts are executed THEN the system SHALL run only necessary commands for the target environment
2. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL skip development-only validations
3. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL install only required packages for the target environment
4. WHEN running pre-build checks THEN the system SHALL validate only critical configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and minimal codebase, so that maintenance is easier and deployment is more reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unused files exist THEN the system SHALL remove or consolidate them
2. WHEN duplicate functionality exists THEN the system SHALL eliminate redundancy
3. WHEN configuration files are complex THEN the system SHALL simplify them while maintaining functionality
4. WHEN build artifacts exist THEN the system SHALL clean them up properly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable Vercel deployment configuration, so that the application deploys successfully without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN the system SHALL use a single, reliable build command
2. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN the system SHALL have clear documentation and examples
3. WHEN the deployment process runs THEN the system SHALL complete without timeout or memory issues
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL serve all pages and API endpoints correctly
