# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the Vercel deployment failure where the build process cannot find required TypeScript and ESLint dependencies, despite them being present in package.json devDependencies. The system needs to ensure reliable deployment on Vercel with proper dependency resolution and build configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to deploy successfully on Vercel, so that the production build process completes without dependency errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Vercel build process runs THEN the system SHALL successfully install all required TypeScript dependencies
2. WHEN the build process executes type checking THEN the system SHALL find typescript and @types/react packages
3. WHEN ESLint runs during the build THEN the system SHALL find the eslint package and configuration
4. WHEN the Next.js build completes THEN the system SHALL generate production-ready assets without errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent dependency resolution across environments, so that local development and production builds use the same package versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL use the same package versions in development and production
2. WHEN the build runs locally THEN the system SHALL produce the same results as the Vercel build
3. WHEN package-lock.json exists THEN the system SHALL use exact versions specified in the lockfile
4. IF dependency conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL resolve them consistently across environments

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper build configuration for Vercel, so that the deployment process follows Next.js best practices and handles TypeScript correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Vercel detects the project THEN the system SHALL use the correct Next.js build settings
2. WHEN TypeScript files are processed THEN the system SHALL apply proper type checking and compilation
3. WHEN the build cache is used THEN the system SHALL invalidate cache appropriately for dependency changes
4. IF build errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deployment to handle edge cases and build optimizations, so that the production application performs well and deploys reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL optimize bundle size and performance
2. WHEN static assets are generated THEN the system SHALL apply proper compression and caching headers
3. WHEN environment variables are used THEN the system SHALL properly substitute them during build
4. IF memory or timeout limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with appropriate error messages
